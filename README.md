# Tweet Extraction
This project contains a toolbox of built-in methods that can extract information from a dataset of tweets from [Twitter](https://twitter.com/).

The main objective was to develop accurate classes to extract, filter and create social networks over a prospective dataset, implementing test cases based on *software testing* principles according to the provided specifications. This is achieved by:

* Devising a series of test cases by dividing the input into several partitions,
* Documenting and implementing these test cases,
* Developing the function bodies, and finally
* Making sure that the implementation is according to each test case.

By the end of this project, the program had successfully ran against a collection of 131 test cases, 109 of them being developed by the MIT course staff. The complete description of the project can be found in `project.pdf` file, meanwhile the result for each individual test case is available in `my-grader-report.xml`.

**Special acknowledgment:** Rob Miller and the whole MITx's team, for developing this case study for the (6.005.1x) Software Construction in Java course.
